Django-Envie
============

This module helps to set environment variable for your Django application from a _.env.py_ file placed inside the project directory.

You can also place your _.env.py_ outside of the project directory where you have your _.git_ folder.


Installation
------------
```
pip install django-envie
```


Your _.env.py_ file should be formatted this way:

DB_NAME = "sector_seven"
DB_USER = "homer_simpson"
DB_PASSWORD = "Close, but you're way off."
